*Working with TypeScript as a beginner; not as scary as it seems?*

We all start somewhere in all aspects of life. From taking your first steps, to the first wordle you ever completed, and in my case, your first experience learning and coding in TypeScript. Quite frankly, I was a bit intimidated with learning a new programming language in the first week of my software engineering course, but after completeting rigorous and rather tedious FreeCodeCamp and W3 practice courses for JavaScript and subsequently TypeScript, I can say that this was the easiest and most enjoyable experience using a new programming language yet. 

## Prior Experience

Before I begin to share more details about my experience picking up TypeScript I think it would be good to contextualize what my starting point was in terms of my background with programming. As a current junior computer science major at UH Manoa, I first learnt how to code in java and coded several assignmnets involving data structures and algorithims so I was already familiar with most of the concepts shown in my practice course. I also coded in C and C++ in another course following my previous two courses that solely used java. Therefore, from creating variables, to writing recursive functions, it was nothing I hadn't seen before although it was nice to brush up on my coding skills. Now that I have provided my prior experience to give a clear starting point perhaps you (the reader of course) could comnpare your starting point to mine in order to better gage how learning javascript and typescript would go for you. Perhaps you still need to learn some of these fundamnetal concepts, or maybe you're far beyond the scope of my abilities, knowing how far along you are in your coding journey in comparison to mine could potentially help manage your own expectations for how learning these languages will go.


## Learning the underlaying language: JavaScript

In order to understand the purpose and how to utilize typescript's capabilities, my professor had our class first learn the basics of JavaScript. My initial thoughts on JavaScript were, "wow this is just like the other languages I've learned with some slight differences". For example, while Java uses system.out.println, JavaScript uses the shorter console.log in order to print an output to the terminal. Also, instead of declaring the type explicitly like in Java, JavaScript wouldn't require specifying the type and you'd simply use let, const, etc. to help determine the immutability of the variables. I did find it very convenient however when I found out I would no longer need to do the rather annoying process of concatenating string with addition spaces and plus signs. In JavaScript, you can use backticks (`) which would eliminate the need for those "Hi my name is " + name " and I like ice cream." scenarios. Later on however, I began to notice more signficant differences. One of the more vital (and more difficult to understand) was that in JavaScript, the variables can change their type at runtime. This is quite the drastic change from Java and C which enforced type safety and was a large component of coding in those languages. Took some time to wrap my head around that concept, but with more practice, it began to make sense. Later in the FreeCodeCamp lessons, ES6 and its featues were introduced and it gave the language a solid update for lack of better phrasing. The arrow functions and default parameters for example gave what felt like a nice quality of life patch in comparison to the older JavaScript verison.  



## Getting to the Meat and Potatoes: TypeScript

Ah, alas, we have arrived at our much anticipated destination, TypeScript. The first piece of information that was made clear is that TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. It is a build of JavaScript that adds type signatures. Now, TypeScript was starting to look more like those previous languages I worked with which helped in understanding type signatures and their usage to begin with. TypeScript to me felt like an implementation of more defined structure to JavaScript that gives it more of a traditional program feel. 



## Final Thoughts

Ultimately, the process of learning JavaScript then TypeScript had it's fair share of road bumps and areas of confusion (90% JavaScript), the transition itself felt smooth and rather fun quite honestly. Actually using my brain and having to pull concepts and prior knowledge from Java/C and corroborating it with what I recently learned about JavaScript provided a unique experience. Compared to the previous languages I had learnt, it was a more enjoyable process and felt rather basic and straightforward in comparison. Maybe it was due to that prior experience that it felt that way, I won't deny it played a large role, but the point still stands. For Typescript, it was completing a puzzle that I already had all the pieces for, I just needed to place them in their proper location, rather than having to formulate the pieces from scratch. Hopefully that metaphor made sense, it sounded cool in my head at least. Anyway, I'm honestly very excited to continue learning and coding and TypeScript, and I'd encourage any other aspiring software engineers or folks just trying to dabble in a little bit of programming to give it a shot!
