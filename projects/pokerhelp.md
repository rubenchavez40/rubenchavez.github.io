summary: "I programmed a C project to help you stop losing your money in Vegas."
---

  I created a C program that is a betting helper/probability calculator for Texas Hold-em poker. It will return a probability of having a winning hand only if the user doesn't fold beforehand which the program accounts for. This is based on the strength of the hand, and the cards unveiled at any given stage (initial hand, flop, turn, river) and will give the user updated probability-based suggestions. For example, the amount of chips to play based on the amount of chips you currently hold. As a disclaimer, this code does not account for: 3 or 4 of a kind, flush/royal flush/straight flush, or full house, but if you have any of these hands go all in!

  This project was for an intro to computer science class focused on program structure where the prompt was simple, create any kind of program that uses 5 math functions. Not only did I include my required math functions like pow(), log(), etc. but I also made an interactive program that helped me enhance my skills in input handling. It also could serve quite useful in Vegas, although I do think they'd get quite suspicious if I brought my laptop to the poker table. Either way, this project provided me with experience in implementation of fundamental math functions, working on I/O handling with user interaction, and overall problem-solving in C.
