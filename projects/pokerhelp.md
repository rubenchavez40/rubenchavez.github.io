summary: "A personal anthology of my works in the English 100 course I took at UH Manoa, and how it evolved and refined my writing."
---

The purpose of this Anthology was to demonstrate my best work in the English 100 course I took. I took the creative liberty of turning this anthology into an audio Podcast to help captivate the emotions and tone of my writings. This gave more personality and helped display a more accurate depicition/interpretation of these writings in the way I intended so the audience could see my own vision more clearly.
