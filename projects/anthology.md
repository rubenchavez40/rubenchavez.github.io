summary: "A personal anthology of my works in the English 100 course I took at UH Manoa, and how it evolved and refined my writing."
---

  The purpose of this anthology was to demonstrate my best work in the English 100 course I took. I took the creative liberty of turning this anthology into an audio podcast to help capture the emotions and tone of my writings. This gave the work more personality and helped display a more accurate depiction and interpretation of my writings in the way I intended, so the audience could see my vision more clearly. We were also required to provide some of our own favorite pieces of literature or media and include them in our work to help convey the anthology's message and strengthen the theme. I searched extensively for what I believed would be the best outside sources that would be fitting for my project.

  Additionally, we were grouped into pairs, and conveniently my girlfriend was in the same class, so we were able to partner up. The reason we were split into groups was to help peer-review each other's work as well as "feature" in our partner's final anthology. The professor knew most people would be making videos for their projects, so he also wanted to give everyone a cameraman or camerawoman. Although working with my girlfriend certainly made the teamwork aspect easier, writing her lines in the podcast and directing her on when to give me certain cues was an experience I had not had before, as projects like this I had previously handled on my own. Ultimately, I demonstrated an ability to piece together various forms of literature and outside sources into a final project that creatively and accurately depicted the work I wanted to share with the world, all while collaborating effectively in a team.
